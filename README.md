# ProjectEX Reforged - 1.21.1+ NeoForge Port

**A modern NeoForge port of ProjectEX, extending ProjectE with low-lag EMC generation, improved transmutation tables, and massive EMC storage solutions.**

**Porting ProjectEX from Forge 1.12.2/1.16.5 to NeoForge 1.21.1+**

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources for porting **ProjectEX** to modern Minecraft versions (1.21.1+) using the NeoForge modding platform.

ProjectEX is an unofficial extension mod for ProjectE that provides:
- Single block, low lag EMC trees (Power Flowers & Collectors)
- An improved Transmutation tablet
- EMC linking systems for external mods (AE2, Refined Storage)
- EMC Relays
- Magnum Stars & Colossal Stars
- Knowledge Sharing Book
- Craftable Tome of Knowledge
- The Final Star
- And more EMC-based utilities

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Debug EMC generation** (CRITICAL)
   - Verify capability registration
   - Check tick logic in CollectorBlockEntity
   - Test EMC transfer between blocks

2. **Verify crash reports**
   - Get new crash logs if still occurring
   - Test Arcane Tablet and Stone Table in-game

   - Integrate Refined Storage 2.0.0 API
   - Complete JEI recipe transfer

4. **Multiplayer testing**
